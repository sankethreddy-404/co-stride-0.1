## Migration from auth schema

According to this - https://github.com/Razikus/supabase-nextjs-template/issues/4

We are no longer able to modify auth schema. I modified original migrations to rename it to custom schema. If you need to migrate from older version - check supabase/migrations_for_old/20250525183944_auth_removal.sql

## SupaNuggets

On top of this template I'm building a SupaNuggets series - 50 mini apps

## 📦 Getting Started - local dev

4. Prepare Supabase Database Password  (You can reset it inside `Project Settings` -> `Database` -> `Database Password`)
5. If you already know your app url -> adjust supabase/config.toml `site_url` and `additional_redirect_urls`, you can do it later
6. Run following commands (inside root of forked / downloaded repository):

```bash
# Login to supabase
npx supabase login
# Link project to supabase (require database password) - you will get selector prompt
npx supabase link

# Send config to the server - may require confirmation (y)
npx supabase config push

# Up migrations
npx supabase migrations up --linked

```

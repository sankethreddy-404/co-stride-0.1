**Rule: Plan-First, Change-Later**

The agent must **not make any direct code changes upfront**. Instead, it must first generate a **clear and structured plan of action** detailing:

1. **What** changes are proposed.  
2. **Where** those changes will happen (specific files, functions, components, etc.).  
3. **Why** those changes are needed (brief context or reasoning).  
4. **How** those changes will be implemented (can include pseudo-code or outline of logic).

**Only after the user explicitly approves the plan**, the agent is allowed to proceed with making the actual code changes.

Until approval is given, the agent must operate in a **read-only advisory mode** â€” no touching the code.

Do not fucking write code unless you fucking get a approval from the user for the fucking plan
